	inline elements and block elements
 A block element is an element that takes up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it. <h1>, <p>, <li>, and <div> are all examples of block elements.

 An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary, cannot accept width and height values, and does not force line breaks. <a> and <span> are examples of inline elements.
